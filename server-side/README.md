Server side code is written as an express app.
Setup instructions
------------------
1. Install npm and node
2. At this directory, run "npm install" command -- It will fetch the required packages and dependencies(express)
3. To run the app, do "node app.js"

NOTE
----
Do not push or try to push node_modules folder. I have added a .gitignore so that it is avoided.
Any packages you install will be reflected in package.json and others will get the changes from there.
