--------
Implemented basic rest endpoints for login, register user, admin access,

Need to change sessions to jwt tokens as per Harshraj's request.
In a load balanced environment, sessions will need sticky sessions enabled in Load balancer.
Need to add other endpoints for inventory access and management.
Will need to help whoever is working on UI to integrate currently working endpoints.
